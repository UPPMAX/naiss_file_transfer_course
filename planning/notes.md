Add use cases

- Introduce many tools, but "demo or similar" just a few
- Pros and cons with other tools and best choices for different OS
- ssh is needed
- everyone should not use thinlinc for all interaction with our systems

- Joachim wanted maximum 3 h, rather 2h
  - @bclaremar thinks that is too short or we make sure to fit in 3 hrs.
