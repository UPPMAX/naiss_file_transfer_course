During the day, however, even though I felt not at the peak of my abilities, I did a reasonable job.</p> <p>Based on the first NAISS-wide 'Intro to Python' course (of 2025-03-04), all we could expect is that 25% of all registered participants would show up. This turned out to be true, with 24% (37 registrations, 9 learners that stayed the whole course).</p> <p>How well the schedule would work was a big unknown. I talked to my colleague that I want him to teach, but with a student-centered approach, this may not have worked. We were both open and flexible about this. The schedule, however, turned out reasonably well, with my colleague indeed being able to lead his sessions in the allotted times.</p> <p>The breaks were a source of confusion: the first was at 9:50, the second at 11:00.

They were delighted when <code>scp</code> worked directly. Maybe we should start with <code>scp</code>, as it is already pre-installed on all computers?</p> <p>These are the amount of learners per cluster, including learners that were there for short amount of time and/or used two clusters:</p> HPC cluster name Number of learners Alvis 3 Bianca 1 COSMOS 1 Dardel 0 Kebnekaise 1 Rackham 2 Tetralith 3 <p>I think the comparison of the different tools should have been done stronger:</p> <ul> <li>[x] Add 'Can do remote to remote yes/no'</li> <li>[x] Add 'Can do large files yes/no'</li> <li>[x] Add 'Asks to overwrite yes/no'</li> <li>[x] Add 'Suitable for sensitive data yes/no'</li> <li>[x] Add 'Tolerant to interrupted connection yes/no'</li> </ul> <p>I enjoyed working together with my colleague: it felt we were a team to me.</p> <p>Me and my colleague talked a lot in how to make the learners move between rooms.

In such a way, the faster groups can go through the course faster.</p> <p>The learners were great: they we helping each other and were flexible in welcoming new guests to their rooms.</p> <p>All in all, I think we did a reasonable job for a first course iteration and I think we have enough ideas to smoothen this out.</p>"},{"location":"reflections/20250307/#reflection-on-evaluation-results","title":"Reflection on evaluation results","text":"<ul> <li>Number of registrations: 37</li> <li>Number of active learners: 9 (24% show-up rate)</li> <li>Number of evaluations: 8 (89% response rate)</li> <li>Average confidence: 3.3 (out of 5)</li> <li>Success score (i.e. average confidence rescaled to 100%): 66%</li> </ul> <p>So, the weakest session was <code>rsync</code>.

This course mentions that a good   camera setup is strongly recommended. I asked 3 learners I met in a breakout   room: 3 out 3 did not have a camera installed. This may have a historical   reason too: in the morning 'Command line 101',   there was a recording of the session, with only 1 or 33 learners having on   their camera. I asked the learner: he/she kept the camera on as he/she   thinks it is nicer for the teacher.   I can imagine the learners expect more passive learning after lunch.</p> <ul> <li>[ ] Ask NAISS training coordinator:   could it be clearer advertised to have cameras?</li> <li>[ ] Ask NAISS training coordinator: could we be first on the day?</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Additionally, there was no Prior.

However:</p> <ul> <li>It was too unclear to learners which HPC cluster they have:   suggest to NAISS to dedicate 1 hour to this, see below</li> <li>It was too unclear which learners were actually there:   again, use a Prior to get more cameras on</li> <li>It was too unclear for learners what to do in a breakout room:   simplify text: done!</li> </ul> <p>There was a better way before that I used:</p> <ul> <li>Ask learners to raise their hand if they want to work alone,   then assign them to a room myself</li> <li>Couple the remaining learners myself in groups of two</li> </ul> <p>Use this way again next time: it is worth the time!</p> <ul> <li>[<code>DONE</code>] Add to course material</li> </ul> <p>One feature of the disconnect with the learners (i.e. the many black screens) is that it became awkwardly clear how many were actually there! After most learners found their room, there were still around eight black screens (around a third!). Some of these were learners that came back to the course later. Some of these learners never showed any sign of life at all.</p> <p>The observer mentioned that there was a question in the Q&amp;A section of the Zoom room. The Q&amp;A was enabled for the teachers that used the same Zoom room in the morning. I answered the question and turned of the Q&amp;A.</p> <ul> <li>[ ] Remember: disable the Zoom Q&amp;A</li> </ul> <p>Thanks to the previous observer, I used my SciLifeLab account to create a Google Form, as it would look more professional. However, the evaluation forms were not open to all (they were only open to SLL people). Luckily, the third learner that was sent home earlier tried it out and told me.

I assume this worked so badly, because there was never made a proper connection to the learners. Again, dare to do proper teaching!</p> <p>I was happy to have done some polls, confirming that we did achieve the intended learning outcomes:</p> <ul> <li>After the first break: all learners were able to login in at least 1 way</li> <li>After the second break: all learners were able to transfer files   in at least 1 way</li> <li>At the end of the day: 9 out of 10 learners were able to transfer files   in at least 2 ways</li> </ul> <p>I was happy how it worked out with my colleague teacher. We met before the teaching and discussed how to decide on how to follow the learners. We decided to make those decisions in the breaks. We did. It worked great. Besides that, we both went through the breakout rooms (from different directions). We seem to know what to do.</p> <p>I did miss his ideas on how the day went. He seemed stressed, as he had to teach the day after too. Instead of pressing him for time, I let him get back to work. I think that that is the better choice. But I do miss hearing his ideas :-)</p> <p>I was happy how it worked with the observer. She was properly introduced and she got properly ignored by the learners.
