I would suggest to facilitate the zoom link of the course also via mail,   even if it is the same moment the course starts.   The reason for this is that the first part of the course is   about connecting to the server,   a prerequisite that was already needed to obtain the zoom link.   I missed the first 15 minutes of the course as I was struggling with that.   Another suggestion is to include instructions for Windows users,   for example in the FileZilla transfer and rsync parts.

The amount of links and documentation to various clusters is amazing.   The course is very interactive and the teachers are very supportive   and lively during the zoom sessions.
