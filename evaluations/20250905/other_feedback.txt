Probably a live-stream-walk-through session will be good. This combine with pre-recorded video will help the students.
NIce (naiss...) course with different levels, and enthusiastic teachers Björn and Richèl.

The course website is good and looks clearly a lot of effort was put in. Looking forward to any other courses on HPC offered by your team
Instead of just sending us to group rooms and documentation web pages, it would be good to first go through the most important commands for each task, for example the general rsync command for a file, a folder etc. and what to think of. Now it seemed as if it was different for different clusters, which it is not. Group rooms were still useful, but this would make the course go faster so that we could learn more.
It was very useful to get an overview of the tools available! Björn and Richèl are very patient and experienced. It would be nice to have more time to discuss with the teachers about the pros and cons of tools and when to use them.
Even though FileZilla is open source, I couldn't try it given the IT policies
The course was helpful. Good team work in the zoom rooms was key, and I appreciated that the teachers were stopping by to ensure we were on track. I would suggest to facilitate the zoom link of the course also via mail, even if it is the same moment the course starts. The reason for this is that the first part of the course is about connecting to the server, a prerequisite that was already needed to obtain the zoom link. I missed the first 15 minutes of the course as I was struggling with that. Another suggestion is to include instructions for Windows users, for example in the FileZilla transfer and rsync parts. Thanks for the course!
The course was valuable
