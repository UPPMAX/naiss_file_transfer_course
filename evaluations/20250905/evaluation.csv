Now it seemed as if it was different for different clusters, which it is not. Group rooms were still useful, but this would make the course go faster so that we could learn more. "

Good team work in the zoom rooms was key, and I appreciated that the teachers were stopping by to ensure we were on track. I would suggest to facilitate the zoom link of the course also via mail, even if it is the same moment the course starts. The reason for this is that the first part of the course is about connecting to the server, a prerequisite that was already needed to obtain the zoom link. I missed the first 15 minutes of the course as I was struggling with that. Another suggestion is to include instructions for Windows users, for example in the FileZilla transfer and rsync parts. Thanks for the course!"
