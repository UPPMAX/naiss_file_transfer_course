The planning phase of the course is settling down:
to me it felt to just wait to find out -by trail and error-
what the NAISS constraints were.

I just completed sketching the course's website,
with all pages being present, either as stubs (to be filled in)
or copy-pastes from UPPMAX-only courses (to be made NAISS-wide).

I've updated my pages to be NAISS-wide now
and am working on the lesson plans.
In that way, my colleague can have all the time to work
on his sessions in peace.
