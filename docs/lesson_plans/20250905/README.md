I've updated all course material to include LUMI and Pelle.
All issues are done.

I've asked if BC could use my help, he gave me something to do, and I did it.

Let's take a look at the schedule and get a status:

Time  |Teacher|Topic                                                 |Status

BC reported that there are 29 registrations. Based
on the 27% show-up rate of the previous' course iteration,
one expects 8 learners. However, that last course iteration,
there was 1 in 4 that did not do the prerequisites.
In this course, these persons do not show up, as they
cannot find the Zoom link.
Hence, I predict 8 minus 25% = 6 learners to be present.

For the 'voting' session at 11:15, I've prepared a Zoom poll:

Done!
