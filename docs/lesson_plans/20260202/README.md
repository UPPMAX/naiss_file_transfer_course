- Part of the NAISS Intro Week

## 2026-01-09

This will be the first time this course is taught (1) as part of
the (first ever) NAISS intro week, (2) with login being added to the
course goals.

I am still
[discussing the schedule](https://github.com/UPPMAX/naiss_file_transfer_course/issues/74)
with BC, but what is clear is that I will do the first hour, with login.

I look forward to put that into course material.

But first, let's go through the introductory page (e.g. course outcomes, etc).
