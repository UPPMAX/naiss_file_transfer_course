# Lesson plan 2026-02-02

- Author: Richel
- Date: 2026-02-02
- Part of the NAISS Intro Week

## 2026-01-09

This will be the first time this course is taught (1) as part of
the (first ever) NAISS intro week, (2) with login being added to the
course goals.

I am still
[discussing the schedule](https://github.com/UPPMAX/naiss_file_transfer_course/issues/74)
with BC, but what is clear is that I will do the first hour, with login.

I look forward to put that into course material.
It will be especially nice to resolve the Dardel documentation:
there is a new website for that now, at
[`https://github.com/menzzana/NAISS-support-web`](https://github.com/menzzana/NAISS-support-web).
However,
[it does not automatically deploy yet](https://github.com/menzzana/NAISS-support-web/issues/8),
so I cannot link to the rendered pages yet.

But first, let's go through the introductory page (e.g. course outcomes, etc).

## 2026-01-26 Peer observation

I will have a colleague observing and we have not yet discussed which
of the three hours she will observe.

- For the first hour:
    - How is the teamplay between me and the other teacher?
    - What do you think are features of good teaching?
      Which did I do and did I do the opposite of?
- For the third hour:
    - How is the teamplay between me and the other teacher?
    - What do you think are features of good teaching?
      Which did I do and did I do the opposite of?

I will have an observer!

- Do introduce the observer
    - Learners are not allowed to ask questions about the course content:
      she is not a teaching assistant
    - She is free to do whatever she wants, including asking questions
- Tell the observer beforehand:
    - She is free to do whatever she wants,
      including asking questions, turning on/off camera,
      introducing herself yes/no
    - Make written notes in any 'normal' text format. Plaintext is
      fine and preferred
