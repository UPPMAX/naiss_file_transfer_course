        - asks if you want to overwrite target files
        - possible to resume file transfer after a broken connection.
        - handle bulk file transfers
        - modify directories
        - and encrypt or decrypt specific files

## Procedure

- [`sftp` in UPPMAX documentation](https://docs.uppmax.uu.se/software/rackham_file_transfer_using_sftp)

### Example Rackham

In the terminal, run `sftp` to connect to Rackham by doing:

```bash
sftp [username]@rackham.uppmax.uu.se
```

where `[username]` is your UPPMAX username, for example:

```bash
sftp sven@rackham.uppmax.uu.se
```

If asked, give your center's password.
You can get rid of this prompt if you have setup SSH keys

Upload/download files to/from Rackham

In `sftp`, upload/download files to/from Rackham.

Basic `sftp` command can be found [here](https://github.com/UPPMAX/UPPMAX-documentation/blob/main/docs/software/sftp.md).
