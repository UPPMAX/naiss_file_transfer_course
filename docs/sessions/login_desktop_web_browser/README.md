# Login to a desktop environment via a web browser

!!!- info "Learning outcomes"

    - Practice using the documentation of your HPC center
    - Understand what a remote desktop environment is
    - Can log in to a remote desktop environment using a web browser

???- question "For teachers"

    Teaching goals are:

    - Learners have practiced using the documentation of their HPC cluster
    - Learners understand what a remote desktop environment is
    - Learners can log in to a remote desktop environment using a web browser

    Teaching non-goals are:

    - Explain that the website used uses ThinLinc

    Prior questions:

    - What is a remote desktop environment?

    Feedback questions:

        - A: a typical graphical environment to interact with your computer

## What is a remote desktop environment?

> A remote desktop environment, accessed via a web browser

You are very likely to be using a desktop environment
of your local computer right now.
All NAISS HPC clusters provide such a desktop environment, yet remotely.

## Why login to a remote desktop environment?

A remote desktop environment is more a more familiar way to work with
computers (and HPC clusters) for most people.

A remote desktop environment, especially via a web browser,
is perfect for introducing your low-tech-savvy colleague
to the NAISS HPC clusters.

## Why use a web browser?

Because you've probably already installed one :-)

???- question "How difficult will this be?"

    This depends only on your HPC cluster:

    <!-- markdownlint-disable MD013 --><!-- Tables cannot be split up over lines, hence will break 80 characters per line -->

    TODO: revise this table

    HPC Cluster|Difficulty|Reason
    -----------|----------|-------------------------------
    Alvis      |Medium    |Uses SSH keys, must be in SUNET
    Berzelius  |Easy      |Uses password
    Bianca     |Medium    |Uses password, must be in SUNET

Here, we log in to your HPC cluster's remote desktop environment.

### Exercise 1: login to your HPC cluster's remote desktop environment

Go to the documentation of your HPC center,
then answer these questions:

- Find the page about how to login to your HPC cluster's remote desktop
  environment using a web browser

???- question "I cannot find it. Where is it?"
