## Connecting and file transfer 7 March, 2025

!!! info "About"

    This is the text of the NAISS Training Newsletter of 7 March, 2025

In this 3-hour workshop you learn to transfer files to and from Swedish academic HPC clusters. We will cover graphical as well as terminal tools and you will work highly interactively. At the end of the day, you should be comfortable in transferring files between your local computer and a cluster and cross-clusters, and choosing the right tools for your use cases.

The workshop is intended for beginner users but with some Linux experience, see the course link below. You do not need to be a member of a NAISS project in order to join the workshop. A course project on one of the NAISS clusters will be available to those.

When: Tuesday, March 7 2025, 09:00-12:00
Where: online via Zoom
