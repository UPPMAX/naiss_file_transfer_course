# Reflection

I was well prepared for the fourth iteration of this course:
for me there was not much new. Me and BC reversed the order and
now `scp` gets to go first. This meant that BC also did the introduction.
I would have the summary at the end as extra, which is trivial
to do.

I did miss doing the introduction. I feel I know the purpose of an introduction
(even) better, as I wrote that material.
Maybe I should do it next time anyways? 
We decided against this, to have less switches, yet
I think that it would be fine: I feel me and BC are a great team. 

- [ ] Suggest RB doing the introduction again

I predicted 6 learners, where BC predicted 15. BC was right: I would
say on average we had 15 learners. I did write down 17 unique attendent names,
of which 2 dropped out within 30 minutes.

During my parts, I was happy that there was enough time to connect
to most of the learners in the breakout rooms. I enjoyed my time with this
group.

There was a group that found a mistake in my course material,
which I fixed during the course: there was plenty of time.

One thing that can be improved is -also suggested by BC- to have
all learners get the Zoom room URL from a course project:
2 out of 15 learners had to be given extra attention to make this work. 

- [ ] All learners must find the Zoom room URL on the NAISS course project

BC also suggested to do a NAISS login course.
This would be easy, as we already have most materials for it.
I would be happy to teach this.

- [ ] Consider doing a NAISS login course

I think the cluster-to-cluster file transfer did not take off:
as far as I've seen, not a single learner did this.
This could be explained by the topics at the vote (I copy-paste):

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD013 --><!-- Tables cannot be split up over lines, hence will break 80 characters per line -->

Teacher|Topic                                         |Why to pick
-------|----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------
R      |[File transfer using `rsync`](rsync/README.md)|More powerful version of `scp`
B      |[Transfer tips](transfer_tips/README.md)      |General applicable tips
B      |[File transfer using `sftp`](sftp/README.md)  |A command-line file transfer 'portal'

<!-- markdownlint-enable MD013 -->

I think there should be an extra row for cluster-to-cluster transfer.

- [ ] Suggest to add an extra row at
  [the voting session](https://uppmax.github.io/naiss_file_transfer_course/sessions/vote/)
