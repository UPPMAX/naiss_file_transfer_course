# Reflection

## First hour

I was unhappy, because:

- I did not have/take the time to talk about
  HPC clusters in general. One learner
  indicated this too.
  I did predict we would be too short on time, but maybe this is more nuanced:
  I *felt* short on time and *was afraid* to take time away from my colleague.

    - [ ] Ask colleague: should we take the time to properly introduce
      HPC clusters with a Prior?

- I feel the NAISS Intro week should start with a general talk about
  HPC clusters, after which all learners login.

- The flowchart in 'Connect Intro' seemed to
  be too complex, even though it only had one
  question.

    - [`FIXED`] One problem is the word 'ThinLinc' in it:
      it should have been 'remote desktop client'.
      
- There were too many black screens. This course mentions that a good
  camera setup is strongly recommended. I asked 3 learners I met in a breakout
  room: 3 out 3 did not have a camera installed. This may have a historical
  reason too: in the morning 'Command line 101',
  there was a recording of the session, with only 1 or 33 learners having on
  their camera. I asked the learner: he/she kept the camera on as he/she
  thinks it is nicer for the teacher.
  I can imagine the learners expect more passive learning after lunch.

    - [ ] Ask colleague: could it be clearer advertised to have cameras?
