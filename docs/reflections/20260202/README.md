# Reflection

## Before teaching that day

I expected to be preparing in the morning, yet I turned into a technical
assistant, as it is UPPMAX that hosts the Zoom rooms. Logging into Zoom
with my email address turns me into a host automatically. Great!

It did me I would have to make all others co-host by hand. I appeared to
be the least stressed of the three UPPMAX staff, so I sent the others away.

## First hour

I was unhappy, because:

- I did not have/take the time to talk about
  HPC clusters in general. One learner
  indicated this too.
  I did predict we would be too short on time, but maybe this is more nuanced:
  I *felt* short on time and *was afraid* to take time away from my colleague.

    - [ ] Ask colleague: should we take the time to properly introduce
      HPC clusters with a Prior?

    - [ ] Remember: always dare to do a proper teaching cycle

- I feel the NAISS Intro week should start with a general talk about
  HPC clusters, after which all learners login.

- The flowchart in 'Connect Intro' seemed to
  be too complex, even though it only had one
  question.

    - [`FIXED`] One problem is the word 'ThinLinc' in it:
      it should have been 'remote desktop client'.
    - [`FIXED`] I've added a table, better flowchart, etc.
      I am reasonably happy with it now
      
- There were too many black screens. This course mentions that a good
  camera setup is strongly recommended. I asked 3 learners I met in a breakout
  room: 3 out 3 did not have a camera installed. This may have a historical
  reason too: in the morning 'Command line 101',
  there was a recording of the session, with only 1 or 33 learners having on
  their camera. I asked the learner: he/she kept the camera on as he/she
  thinks it is nicer for the teacher.
  I can imagine the learners expect more passive learning after lunch.

    - [ ] Ask NAISS training coordinator: could it be clearer advertised to have cameras?
    - [ ] Ask NAISS training coordinator: could we be first on the day?

  Additionally, there was no Prior. This gives learners a reason to turn on
  their cameras. During the day, however, more learners turned on their
  cameras.

Time |`n_on`|`n_off`|`n_learn`|`n_teach`|`n_total`
-----|------|-------|---------|---------|---------
13:15|1     |24     | 25      |2        | 27
14:07|6     |19     | 25      |2        | 27
15:51|10    |3      | 13      |2        | 15

I was unhappy with assigning breakout rooms to the learners.
I used the schedule below:

HPC cluster name  |Main breakout room
------------------|------------------
Alvis silent      |Room 1
Alvis group       |Room 2
Bianca silent     |Room 3
Bianca group      |Room 4
COSMOS silent     |Room 5
COSMOS group      |Room 6
Dardel silent     |Room 7
Dardel group      |Room 8
Kebnekaise silent |Room 9
Kebnekaise group  |Room 10
Pelle silent      |Room 11
Pelle group       |Room 12
Tetralith silent  |Room 13
Tetralith group   |Room 14
Other silent      |Room 15
Other group       |Room 16
Any, free to use  |Any other room

However:

- It was too unclear to learners which HPC cluster they have
- It was too unclear which learners were actually there
- It was too unclear for learners what to do in a breakout room

There was a better way before that I used:

- Ask learners to raise their hand if they want to work alone,
  then assign them to a room myself
- Couple the remaining learners myself in groups of two

Use this way next time. It is worth the time.





Thanks to the previous observer, I used my SciLifeLab account to create
a Google Form, as it would look more professional.
However, the evaluation forms were not open to all (they
were only open to SLL people). Luckily, the third learner that was sent home
earlier tried it out and told me. Together, we fixed it.

- [ ] Remember that a Google Form on my SciLifeLab account needs to
  open up the URL to all

I was happy to have done some polls, confirming that we did achieve the
intended learning outcomes:

- After the first break: all learners were able to login in at least 1 way
- After the second break: all learners were able to transfer files in at least 1 way
- At the end of the day: 9 out of 10 learners were able to transfer files
  in at least 2 ways

## Recommendation to NAISS

I think the NAISS Intro Week should be a gentle and easy first week to work
with our HPC clusters. I would say it is more important to adapt to
our learners than fit in as much content as possible.

Due to this I recommend:

- 2 hours for the 'Connect' part
- 3 hours for the 'File transfer' part

Having this course the full first day would help even the utmost beginner
to have an easy first day on our HPC clusters. I think we should prefer
this over rushing our new users.
