## Observations during lessons

During the lessons I observed the timings of me and BC:

Time |Description
-----|--------------------------------
9:04 |Start monologue Introduction
9:11 |Start monologue FileZilla
9:18 |Open BO rooms
9:25 |Done with first visit to BO room
9:50 |Break
10:05|Start monologue SSH
10:08|Start monologue `scp`
10:14|Start questions
10:17|Open BO rooms
11:00|Break
11:15|Start monologues
11:25|Open BO rooms
11:45|Start monologue wrapup
11:50|Start evaluation

The goal was to determine the percentage of exercises:

Time       |Monologue|Dialogue|Exercise|Percentage exercise
-----------|---------|--------|--------|-------------------
9:00-9:50  |18 mins  |0 mins  |32 mins |64 percent
10:05-11:00|9 mins   |3 mins  |33 mins |60 percent
11:15-12:00|25 mins  |0 mins  |20 mins |44 percent
9:00-12:00 |52 mins  |3 mins  |85 mins |61 percent

So 61% of the time it was time for exercises.

I also tracked BC moving through different BO rooms in the `scp`
session (he was never in the main room), just to get a baseline
of speed:

Time |BO room with BC|Duration
-----|---------------|--------
10:17|1 (start)      |6 mins
10:23|2              |7 mins
10:31|1              |7 mins
10:38|2              |6 mins
10:44|1              |16 mins
11:00|Break          |.
