# Reflection

## Before teaching

I had nearly no time to prepare:
I even added an exercise for `rsync`
under lesson time.
I wondered if that would pose a problem.

## After teaching

At around 8:59 I saw BC freeze: unprepared learners sent him emails
that they needed the URL to the Zoom room. I clearly shared that
it is OK not to accommodate for that; that we should reward the learners
that did prepare. After this we started.

The lack of preparation posed no problem.
Me and BC working together felt fun and smooth to me.
I asked BC if he felt the same and he did.


All learners went back to work before the course ended:
the earliest at 10:30, the last 11:30. I enjoyed that:
there is no need to keep learners in the course after
reaching the course objectives.

The group was fast! This could be because we selected for learners
that actually prepare. I prefer this over punishing the learners
that prepare by letting unprepared learners in (and then getting
the most attention).

The introduction was 10 instead of 5 minutes.
Me and BC already updated the schedule for that.
