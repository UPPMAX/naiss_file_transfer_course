# Frequently Asked Questions

## Why is the repository owner `UPPMAX` instead of NAISS?

Because NAISS does not have a GitHub owner page yet.

## Why are there so many prerequisites?

Because of constraints.

While planning the course,
we started out with two hour to
teach about login and filesystem navigation,
and four hours to do actual fle transfer.

When the constraint was added that the
course must be maximally three hours,
it meant that we would teach what the course
is about in the minority of the time.
As teachers, we accepted this at first,
and would only teach FileZilla and `rsync`.

However, then another constraint was added:
there should be more file transfer tools
discussed.

Instead of lecturing (we should not `[Hattie, 2023]`),
we decided to add prerequisites instead
