# Notes from common NAISS training meeting 21 Nov

- Since the we had defined already the content with many tools and use cases there was a common hope to keep many of the tools and not focus too much on very few

- Add use cases
    - suggestion: include scp linux-to-linux, like for between systems
- Introduce many tools, but "demo or similar" just a few
    - Pros and cons with other tools and best choices for different OS
- ssh is needed
    - everyone should not use thinlinc for all interaction with our systems
    - limited numbers of licenses, fast checks to do in terminal
- Joachim wanted maximum 3 h, rather 2h
  - @bclaremar and many other in the meeting  thinks that is too short or we make sure to fit in 3 hrs not 2hrs.
