Dear learners,
Welcome to the File transfer course of 2025-11-14!

Please unregister in the registration form or send an email back if you cannot show up!

Also note that Bianca users are encouraged to join our Bianca courses instead. You may follow this course but there is not much time to help you with technical issues this time.

- [Bianca intro](https://docs.uppmax.uu.se/courses_workshops/bianca_intro/)
- [Bianca Intermediate Tue 18 Nov](https://docs.uppmax.uu.se/courses_workshops/bianca_intermediate/)

Please follow the steps in the [prerequisites page](https://uppmax.github.io/naiss_file_transfer_course/prereqs/).
It involves having an account and some kind of allocation project on a cluster.
It may be an existing research project of your group or the course project.
All commands can be run on the login node, not using up your compute allocation!

- 14 Nov at 9.00 (sharp!)
- ZOOM link and passcode are hidden in the instructions!

Help, answers and videos can be found at the course's [FAQ page](https://uppmax.github.io/naiss_file_transfer_course/faq/#prerequisites).

If you have any questions, don’t hesitate to contact Björn at [bjoern_email]

See you next Friday!

Best regards, Björn Claremar & Richèl Bilderbeek
