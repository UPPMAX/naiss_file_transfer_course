## Welcome 1

Dear learners,

Welcome to the File transfer course of 2025-03-07!

These are the four prerequisites (as listed on https://uppmax.github.io/naiss_file_transfer_course/prereqs/ )

- [x] Prerequisite 1/4: You have registered at our registration form
- [ ] Prerequisite 2/4: A user account on a Swedish academic HPC cluster
- [ ] Step 2a: NAISS SUPR account
- [ ] Step 2b: Be member of a project and get a cluster user account (if you don’t already have one)
- [ ] Prerequisite 3/4: Be able to login to an HPC cluster using SSH
  the documentation of that cluster is helpful (if not, contact your cluster's HPC center).
- [ ] Prerequisite 4/4: Have a good Zoom setup

If you don’t already have a Swedish cluster account, you may join our course project with allocation on the Tetralith cluster.
In SUPR, go to Projects in the menu, and Request Membership in Project NAISS 2025/22-373.
I will approve you as soon as I can, and when approved you can go to:  https://supr.naiss.se/account/ and sign up for a cluster account at Tetralith.
 
You may use a different SUPR project if you wish. All commands can be run on the login node, not using up your compute allocation.

- Passcode: `[zoom_passcde]`

## Welcome 2

Hi again!

This time some further info about account preparations!

Since we decided to have an exercise of transferring files between clusters as well, you are all welcome to apply for membership to our course projects at both Tetralith and Alvis.
You may choose only 1 of them if that is enough to in total have access to 2 clusters.
Please try to do this quickly so there is time to get your cluster accounts as well!
In SUPR, go to Projects in the menu, and Request Membership in Project(s) `NAISS 2025/22-373` or/and `NAISS 2025/22-309` (don’t mind the title of the project!).
We will approve you as soon as we can, and when approved you can go to:  https://supr.naiss.se/account/ and sign up for a cluster account at the Tetralith or/and Alvis resource.
 
We are sorry for the late notice! The first iteration of the course made it a bit hard to identify all needs.
See you on Friday!
/Björn
