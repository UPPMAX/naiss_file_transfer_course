Dear learners,

Welcome to the 'Connect and File Transfer' course of 2026-02-02!

Please follow the steps in the [prerequisites page](https://uppmax.github.io/naiss_file_transfer_course/prereqs/).
It involves having an account and some kind of allocation project on a cluster.
It may be an existing research project of your group or the course project.
All commands can be run on the login node, not using up your compute allocation!

- Monday February 2nd at 13:00 (sharp!)
- Zoom link and passcode are hidden in the instructions!

Help, answers and videos can be found at the course's [FAQ page](https://uppmax.github.io/naiss_file_transfer_course/faq/#prerequisites).

Cannot join? Then please unregister in the registration form or send an email!

For Bianca users: this HPC cluster has a day of its own in the NAISS Intro Week,
at the day on sensitive data
(`https://naiss-training.github.io/NAISS-intro-week/sensitive/`).
You are encouraged to follow that day instead.

If you have any questions, don’t hesitate to contact Björn at [bjoern_email]

See you next Monday!

Best regards, Björn Claremar & Richèl Bilderbeek
