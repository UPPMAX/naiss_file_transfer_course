## Welcome 1

Dear learners,

Welcome to the File transfer course of 2025-09-05!

Please unregister in the form or let me know if you cannot show up!

Please follow the steps in the prerequisites page: <https://uppmax.github.io/naiss_file_transfer_course/prereqs/>
It involves having an account and some kind of allocation project on a cluster. It may be an existing research project of your group or a course project.
All commands can be run on the login node, not using up your compute allocation!

- 5 Sep at 9.00 (sharp!)
- ZOOM link and passcode is either given
    - in the project folder of the course
    - or emailed to those with existing research projects.

Help, answers and videos can be found at the course's FAQ page at <https://uppmax.github.io/naiss_file_transfer_course/faq/#prerequisites> .

If you have any questions, never hesitate to contact Björn at `[bjoern_email]`.

See you next Friday!

Best regards,
Björn Claremar & Richèl Bilderbeek.

These are the four prerequisites (as listed on <https://uppmax.github.io/naiss_file_transfer_course/prereqs/> ).

- [x] Prerequisite 1/4: You have registered at our registration form

    - [ ] Step 2a: _NAISS SUPR account_ (<https://supr.naiss.se/>)

- [ ] Prerequisite 3/4: Be able to login to an HPC cluster using SSH
  the documentation of that cluster is helpful (if not, contact your cluster's HPC center).
- [ ] Prerequisite 4/4: Have a good Zoom setup

- If you don’t already have a Swedish _cluster_ account for your research, you may join our course project with allocation on the Tetralith cluster (and Dardel).
In SUPR, go to Projects in the menu, and Request Membership in Project NAISS 2025/22-717.
I will approve you as soon as I can, and when approved you can go to:  <https://supr.naiss.se/account/> and sign up for a cluster account at Tetralith and Dardel.

You may use a different SUPR project if you wish. All commands can be run on the login node, not using up your compute allocation.

## Welcome 2

Hi again!

This time some further info about account preparations!

Since we decided to have an exercise of transferring files between clusters as well, you are all welcome to apply for membership to our course projects at both Tetralith and Alvis.
You may choose only 1 of them if that is enough to in total have access to 2 clusters.
Please try to do this quickly so there is time to get your cluster accounts as well!
In SUPR, go to Projects in the menu, and Request Membership in Project(s) `NAISS 2025/22-373` or/and `NAISS 2025/22-309` (don’t mind the title of the project!).
We will approve you as soon as we can, and when approved you can go to:  <https://supr.naiss.se/account/> and sign up for a cluster account at the Tetralith or/and Alvis resource.

We are sorry for the late notice! The first iteration of the course made it a bit hard to identify all needs.
See you on Friday!
/Björn
