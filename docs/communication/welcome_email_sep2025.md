## Welcome 1

Dear learners,

Welcome to the File transfer course of 2025-09-05!

Please unregister in the form or send an email back if you cannot show up!

Please follow the steps in the prerequisites page: <https://uppmax.github.io/naiss_file_transfer_course/prereqs/>
It involves having an account and some kind of allocation project on a cluster. It may be an existing research project of your group or the course project.
All commands can be run on the login node, not using up your compute allocation!

- 5 Sep at 9.00 (sharp!)
- ZOOM link and passcode are hidden in the instructions!

Help, answers and videos can be found at the course's FAQ page at <https://uppmax.github.io/naiss_file_transfer_course/faq/#prerequisites> .

If you have any questions, never hesitate to contact Björn at `[bjoern_email]`.

See you next Friday!

Best regards,
Björn Claremar & Richèl Bilderbeek.


## Welcome 2 (to be modified later)

Hi again!

This time some further info about account preparations!

Since we decided to have an exercise of transferring files between clusters as well, you are all welcome to apply for membership to our course projects at both Tetralith and Alvis.
You may choose only 1 of them if that is enough to in total have access to 2 clusters.
Please try to do this quickly so there is time to get your cluster accounts as well!
In SUPR, go to Projects in the menu, and Request Membership in Project(s) `NAISS 2025/22-373` or/and `NAISS 2025/22-309` (don’t mind the title of the project!).
We will approve you as soon as we can, and when approved you can go to:  <https://supr.naiss.se/account/> and sign up for a cluster account at the Tetralith or/and Alvis resource.

We are sorry for the late notice! The first iteration of the course made it a bit hard to identify all needs.
See you on Friday!
/Björn
