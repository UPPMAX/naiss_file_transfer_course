- We think `rsync` and FileZilla were possibly weak,
  because of (1) unclear prerequistites and (2) need to install things,
  (3) too many steps to do on some clusters, e .g. Alvis.
  (4) too many terminals: mobaXterm or WSL

- [Decision] Better prerequisites will already have an effect
- [Decision] Course order:
    - How to do thing:
        - FileZilla: R
        - (login and) `scp`: B
        - cluster to cluster file transfer: B
    - How to do things effectively
        - (optional) archiving (especially from terminal): B
        - (optional) `rsync`: R
        - (optional) `sftp`: B
- [Decided] The `(optional)` learning outcomes are shown like that on the website
- Is 'Connecting' part of the course?
    - we feel connecting is a prerequisite. It _is_ in the prerequisites.
      We do take the time for doing this :-)
- Is 'success score' a good measure?
    - [Decision] No, we should measure before and after and use the improvement
      score.
    - [Decision] Next time, we add a pre-evaluation to the registration form, which is
      optional, add why we want this. 
- Should we do transfer between clusters?
    - Yes
    - We add it to the learning outcomes
    - We add it to the schedule
    - B will teach it :-)
- [Decided] Zoom room is found in a file on an HPC cluster.
    - R will document and make a video
    - R will ask Joakim
