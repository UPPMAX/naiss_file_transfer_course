After the teaching of that day, and some time to reflect,
BC and RB had an informal meeting. Here are the notes.

- BC will look into adding compression as
  extra material in the regular sessions.
  RB will add compression in the `rsync`
  session.
- BC will add archiving to `scp` as
  an extra optional exercise.

- Not all users could use FileZilla, as they were not allowed to install it
  by their IT department

- Not all users could use MobaXterm, so no command-line tools at all.
- PowerShell works sometime well
- `pscp` is a tool that may work too
- `rsync` does not work on Windows

- [ ] BC: remind learners to do the prerequisites early
- [ ] RB: mention to use WinSCP if FileZilla cannot in prerequisites
- [ ] RB: mention each prerequisite that not installing it is OK;
  one then has to skip the session :-)
