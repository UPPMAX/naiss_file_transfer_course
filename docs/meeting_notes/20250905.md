After the teaching of that day, and some time to reflect,
BC and RB had an informal meeting. Here are the notes.

These were the items from Richel's reflection:

- [x] Suggest RB doing the introduction again

We agreed. We both felt switching being the main teacher is no problem.
The schedule has been updated.

- [#58](https://github.com/UPPMAX/naiss_file_transfer_course/issues/58)
  All learners must find the Zoom room URL on the NAISS course project

We agreed.

- [#59](https://github.com/UPPMAX/naiss_file_transfer_course/issues/59)
  Consider doing a NAISS login course

We are enthusiastic, yet do not feel we have enough time to do so
left in our schedule.

- [#60](https://github.com/UPPMAX/naiss_file_transfer_course/issues/60)
  Add an extra row for cluster-to-cluster file transfer at
  the voting session

- [#61](https://github.com/UPPMAX/naiss_file_transfer_course/issues/61)
  Ask BC to add an `sftp` column if he thinks it is worth it

Done!

- [#62](https://github.com/UPPMAX/naiss_file_transfer_course/issues/62)
  Take into account: not all tools can be installed!
    - RB: mention to use WinSCP if FileZilla cannot in prerequisites
    - RB: mention each prerequisite that not installing it is OK;
    one then has to skip the session :-)
    - Not all users could use MobaXterm, so no command-line tools at all.
    - PowerShell works sometime well
    - `pscp` is a tool that may work too
    - `rsync` does not work on Windows

Not all users could use FileZilla, as they were not allowed to install it
by their IT department.

Added notes:

- [#63](https://github.com/UPPMAX/naiss_file_transfer_course/issues/63)
  Add compression as an extra exercise within a session
    - BC will look into adding compression as
    extra material in the regular sessions.
    - RB will add compression in the `rsync`
    session.
    - BC will add archiving to `scp` as
    an extra optional exercise.


- [#64](https://github.com/UPPMAX/naiss_file_transfer_course/issues/64)
  BC: remind learners to do the prerequisites early
