## Feedback from informal dialogue

Here is some feedback from a learner we discussed the teaching with afterwards.
There will be overlap with his/her feedback.

### What went well?

Most things went well. The `rsync` apparently went very well,
as the learners were done there quite quickly.
Learners went through exercises fast: everything worked
as it was supposed to (sure: when I went off-script, things
were different).

You are a good team, as the energies balance out:

- Richel can have a bit too much energy
- Bj√∂rn can come accross as a bit too calm/hesitant

### What could be improved?

No idea: it went very smoothly and went very well.

The teachers did not always know the answer of the questions:

- Is FileZilla installed on which HPC clusters?
    - Tip: use Thunar on Tetralith to do exactly the same
    - Yes on Dardel or Rackham ...?
