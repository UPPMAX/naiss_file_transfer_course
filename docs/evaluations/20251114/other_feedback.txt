Thanks a lot for this!
I found the level a bit too easy for a 3hour course, but it fit what was in the learning objectives. Very nice structure with the prerequisite page and how to find the zoom url, that was a nice way to do an exercise which could be used for more aspects of the course.
Perhaps you could provide a bit more detail before moving on to the groups, but I’m still happy with the course.
Overview could be presented in the form of a slide just at start. But it is optional.
