## Any other feedback?

- Thanks a lot for this!
- I found the level a bit too easy for a 3hour course,
  but it fit what was in the learning objectives.
  Very nice structure with the prerequisite page
  and how to find the zoom url,
  that was a nice way to do an exercise which could be used
  for more aspects of the course.
- Perhaps you could provide a bit more detail before moving on to the groups,
  but I’m still happy with the course.
- Overview could be presented in the form of a slide just at start.
  But it is optional.
