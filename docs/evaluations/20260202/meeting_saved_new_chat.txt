12:00:15 From Richèl 'Rea-shell' Bilderbeek [Teacher] To Everyone:
	At 13:00 (sharp!) we will log in to your favorite HPC cluster (including a desktop/visual/graphical environment!) and will transfer files to/from it.
	
	All sessions are pre-recorded and can be found at https://uppmax.github.io/naiss_file_transfer_course/videos/ . There will be no recording during the session itself.
	
	The course homepage is at https://uppmax.github.io/naiss_file_transfer_course/ .
	
	If you attend, please make sure your Zoom setup is good enough. It is in the course prerequisites ( https://uppmax.github.io/naiss_file_transfer_course/prereqs/ ) :-)
	
	See you at 13:00 (sharp!) (to 16:00, max!) in this Zoom room. It will be useful and fun!
	
12:01:03 From Ali Jahangiri To Everyone:
	Thank you for the wonderful session this morning! :)
